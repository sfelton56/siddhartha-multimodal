The sound the current makes is slow and steady and the rapids bring excitement to the soft music the river plays. The blue and green tint to the water creates a landscape that mesmerizes every spectator. This sacred river offers more than just music to the ears and art to the eyes, but offers knowledge to the soul. The river is an escape from time, but most importantly, an escape from suffering. </span></span>â€‹</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>

<blockquote style="text-align:center;"><span><font size="6">He killed his senses, he killed his memory, he slipped from his ego into a thousand different formations. He was animal, was carcass, was rock, was wood, was water, and he always found himself again upon awakening. Sun was shining or moon, he was himself again, swinging in the cycle, felt thirst, overcame thirst, felt new thirst.</font></span></blockquote>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span><span><font size="6">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&#8203; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On his search for spiritual enlightenment, Siddhartha begins his journey with his childhood friend, Govinda, by becoming a Samana. In doing so, they attempt to eliminate the ego and neglect the "self" to reach enlightenment. Siddhartha abandons his impulse to consume anything other than the bare necessities of life, in hopes of&nbsp;achieving&nbsp;Nirvana and breaking the cycle of time.</font></span></span></div>
