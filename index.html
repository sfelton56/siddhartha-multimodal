He imagined the world and all of it’s Gods laughing at what he had become. Siddhartha the child person, once Siddhartha the samana, was lost. His soul, empty of meaning, yearning to be understood, was far from enlightenment.
	</p>
	<p>The river was tantalizing. He longed to succumb to its depths—never to resurface again. Never to face the disappointment that he now felt. Never to reach nirvana. He wished to flow as it flowed, to become whole again. With a deep breath, he took one last look at the world and readied himself for death. 
	</p>
	<p>As he stepped into the water, something deep within his soul began to stir. After years of wandering without purpose, the samana in him longed for peace—not death. Following a lifetime of sleepwalking, the river had awoken his soul. Ashamed of his wish for death, Siddhartha fell into a deep sleep. His life was far from over. His soul, not ready to be reborn, began a new chapter in his journey.

	 <h4 style="text-align:center;"><b>History of Buddhism</b></h4>
    <p>Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, lived around 560-480 BCE. Scholars often refer to Gautama as the Buddha, or the “Enlightened one”. Born into royalty in the city of Kapilavastu, his life was forever changed when he left his palace at the age of 29. He encountered “four signs” outside the palace walls: an old man, a sick person, a corpse, and a mendicant. Gautama, who was raised in a gaudy and privileged home, was flabbergasted by the basic fundamentals of life. After he encountered the fourth and final sign, the mendicant, he decided to shave his head and leave the palace in search of the meaning of life and death. 
	</p>
	<p>The Buddha found a bodhi tree after six years of wandering and suffering. He decided to meditate beneath it until he found the answer to life. There, he was challenged by Mara, the god of desire. He resisted temptation and eliminated the cycle of reincarnation by awaking his soul.

  <div style="color:#fffff;background-color:white;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">	
	  <h4 style="text-align:center;"><b>Siddhartha</b></h4>
    <p>The proud Brahmin beamed at his son. His studious boy followed rules promptly, excelled in his lessons, and set an example for his peers. Yet, one day, he defied his father. He was ready to leave home and continue his education as a Samana. After much deliberation, the father said goodbye to his son. It saddened his heart to let him go, but his soul knew that it was for the best. 
	  </p>
	  <p>The boy was called Siddhartha. For years, he lived in the woods among his brothers. Eventually, they came across the Buddha. The enlightened one. His teachings were sacred and samanas from across the country traveled to hear his voice. Siddhartha, impressed by the oneness of the sacred man’s soul, longed to find nirvana for himself. He set out, destined to learn from his mistakes and not the words of a venerable teacher. Splintering from the samanas, Siddhartha became a lonely wanderer, his soul guiding his way through the world.
	  </p>
	  <h4 style="text-align:center;"><b>Kamala</b></h4>
   <p>Desire, the catalyst for sin, drives our decisions. Appetites for money, sex, and alcohol are briefly sated only to tempt again. As Siddhartha turned away from the woods and entered this world of temptations, he left his life as a Samana and began his life as a child once again. 
	  </p>
	  <p>Slowly, he began to see beauty in his new home. Most beautiful of all was Kamala. The young samana fell in love with his goddess. Having spent years as a student of faith, he now learned the art of love. 
	  </p>
	  <p>As the years went by, Siddhartha, once a cut above his peers, fell into the depths of gambling and greed. He became a successful merchant and squandered his wealth away in fits of jealousy. The lessons he had learned as a boy had left his heart.
	  </p>
	  
	  
	<h4 style="text-align:center;"><b>Vasudeva</b></h4>
   <p>The river, with all of it’s perfect imperfections and charming characteristics, framed Vasudeva’s minimalistic hut. As the ferryman rowed his boat back and forth across the churning water, he was not dulled by monotony. On the contrary, the simple man saw the complexity of the world around him. He listened to the water and heard it speak to him. In spite of his lack of luxury, Vasudeva was at peace.
	  </p>
	  <p>Long ago, he had met Siddhartha the samana. Now, he met Siddhartha once more. This time, the samana was dressed in merchants clothing. His appearance, tired and slightly tattered, contrasted the fire that burned in his eyes. Quickly, the two men took a liking to each other. In an effort to rid himself of the material world, Siddhartha became a man of little wealth once again. He began a new life as the ferryman's apprentice. 
	  </p>
	  <p>Over time, Siddhartha learned to listen. His ears became sensitive to the river and his eyes noticed subtle changes in the world around him. Like Vasudeva before him, the steady flowing of the river brought peace to Siddhartha’s soul.

	  <h4 style="text-align:center;"><b>Govinda</b></h4>
	  <p>Govinda, a follower of Gautama, spent his life in the presence of teachers. He looked for his own enlightenment through the enlightenment of others. Once, Siddhartha and Govinda were best friends, but they had long since gone their separate ways. However, long after the days of their youth, their paths crossed once again. Siddhartha, a humble ferryman, and Govinda, a disciple of the Buddha, reminisced about the life that they had lived.
	  </p>
	  <p>With the river flowing in the background, Govinda could sense that Siddhartha had found nirvana. He had found the peace that had eluded Govinda for years. For all of Govinda’s knowledge and lessons, he did not know wisdom. Siddhartha had found it through experience, not teachings. His journey, through all of it’s facets was the catalyst for his enlightenment.

	<h4 style="text-align:center;"><b>The Journey</b></h4>
		<p>
	The river, destined to flow to the sea, has a purpose. The river’s waters forever move. The sound tells a story. At every point along its banks, the water moves in unison. Laughing, crying, living, and breathing as one. Each droplet of water begins at the same source, but does not always end at the river’s mouth. From humble or high beginnings to success or failure, it is the journey that matters most.
