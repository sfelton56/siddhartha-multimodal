  <p><span class="dropcap">F</span>lowing, the river called out to Siddhartha. His name, once held in high regard, meant nothing to the churning waters at his feet. He imagined the world and all of it’s Gods laughing at what he had become. Siddhartha the child person, once Siddhartha the samana, was lost. His soul, empty of meaning, yearning to be understood, was far from enlightenment.</p><br>
	<p>The river was tantalizing. He longed to succumb to its depths—never to resurface again. Never to face the disappointment that he now felt. He wished to flow as it flowed, to become whole again. With a deep breath, he took one last look at the world and readied himself for death.</p><br>
	<p>As he stepped into the water, something deep within his soul began to stir. After years of wandering without purpose, the samana in him longed for peace—not death. After years of sleepwalking, the river had awoken his soul.

    <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he thirst for knowledge drove Siddhartha to be an exemplary son. However, when the time came, it was time for him to venture off on his own. With the birds chirping and Govinda at his side, Siddhartha set off for the woods.

	  <h4 style="text-align:center;"><b>Kamala</b></h4>
    <p><span class="dropcap">D</span>esire, the catalyst for sin, drives our decisions. Appetites for money, sex, and alcohol are briefly sated only to tempt again. As Siddhartha turned away from the woods and entered this world of temptations, he left his life as a Samana and began his life as a child once again.</p>
    <p>As a man of few possessions, Siddhartha had a fresh start in this world. Slowly, he saw beauty in it. Most beautiful of all was Kamala. The young samana fell in love with his goddess. Having spent years as a student of faith, he now learned the art of love. </p>
	<h4 style="text-align:center;"><b>Vasudeva</b></h4>
    <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he river, with all of it’s perfect imperfections and charming characteristics, framed Vasudeva’s minimalistic hut. As the ferryman rowed his boat back and forth across the churning water, he was not dulled by monotony. On the contrary, the simple man saw the complexity of the world around him. He listened to the water and heard it speak to him. In spite of his lack of luxury, Vasudeva was at peace.</p>
